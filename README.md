# sudoku-solver

This is a project which is used to validate sudoku boards and, later, to automate sudoku board solving. User interface will be implemented later as the project progresses and advances.

The idea for this project came into my mind when I saw my mom struggling while checking if her sudoku solution is correct or not. This program might reduce that struggle and also if sudoku board is incorrectly solved, the program will later return the correct solution.
